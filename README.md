# ``Neubrutalism``

Neubrutalism is a modern design trend inspired by the raw, unrefined look of classic brutalism in architecture. It combines elements of brutalismâ€™s stark, bold aesthetic with softer, more playful and colorful elements.

## Overview

Neubrutalism is a contemporary design movement rooted in the principles of traditional Brutalism, but with a modern twist. While brutalism was characterized by stark, raw, and utilitarian design, neubrutalism softens these harsh aesthetics with playful colors, approachable layouts, and a slightly retro vibe. It's gaining popularity in both web and app design, where it stands out with its bold, unapologetic visuals.
